# Deciv-Return-of-the-Middle-Kingdom
Return of the Middle Kingdom is a Unciv Mod about the aftermath of the catastrophy in Deciv, where KMT forces attempt to reconquer China whilst the CCP is regaining their strength in Beijing. However, there will be other opposing factions that will seek to either assist KMT/CCP factions or attempt to further their own ambitions. Here's the list of factions I'll be adding first
Chinese Communist Party, led by Li Zhi Ming
Kuo Min Tang, led by Zhu Li Jun
Qing Dynasty, led by Aisin-Guoro Zhang Kai
Heavenly Kingdom, led by Hong Zhi Xuan
