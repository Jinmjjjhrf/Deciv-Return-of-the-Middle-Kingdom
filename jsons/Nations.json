Now that the cataclysm is over, the party members began taking control of the Capital once again. Though the people viewed us with suspicion after abandoning them to suffer in the wastelands above, the quick political maneuvering by Li Zhi Min was beginning to restore trust as he began leading a reconstruction effort of Beijing. Not only that, he also saw fit to clear out bandit outposts and pushed the Barbarians out of Beijing, with his most crowning victory being the reclamation and restoration of the Forbidden City - which now acts as the ruling place of the CCP.'",
