Now that the cataclysm was over, the party members began taking control of the Capital once again, and though the people once viewed us with suspicion after abandoning them to suffer in the wastelands above, the quick political manoeuvring by Li Zhi Min, trust was restored as he began leading a reconstruction effort of Beijing. Not only that he also saw fit to clear out bandit outposts and pushing the Barbarians out of Beijing, with his most crowning victory being the Reclamation and restoration of the Forbidden City, which now acts as the ruling place of the CCP.'",

For I, Li Zhi Min solemnly swear, as long as I still live, China will be reunited under the will of the people and the might of communism!'"
